title = "Step 1"
description = "Acquired and prepared memory dumps for analysis."
text = "Collected five memory dump files (0zapftis.vmem, Coreflood.vmem, Memory.mem, Zeus.vmem, WindowsXPProfessional.vmem) and verified integrity before starting analysis."

[[steps]]
title = "Step 2"
description = "Performed image identification and environment setup."
text = "Used Volatility's `imageinfo` plugin to determine the correct profile for each memory dump, ensuring accurate parsing and analysis."

[[steps]]
title = "Step 3"
description = "Enumerated processes, DLLs, and network connections."
text = "Ran Volatility plugins such as `pslist`, `pstree`,`psxview` ,dlllist`, and `netscan` to extract active processes, loaded modules, and open network sockets for each memory image."

[[steps]]
title = "Step 4"
description = "Extracted forensic artifacts and analyzed memory."
text = "Dumped suspicious processes using `procdump`, reviewed command history with `cmdscan`, and analyzed registry hives, kernel memory, and configuration files for indicators of compromise (IOCs)."

[[steps]]
title = "Step 5"
description = "Correlated findings with threat intelligence."
text = "Submitted dumped binaries and suspicious artifacts to VirusTotal and cross-referenced results with known malware families (e.g., Coreflood, Zeus)."

[[steps]]
title = "Step 6"
description = "Documented malicious behavior and recommended mitigations."
text = "Identified persistence mechanisms, C2 communication patterns, and potential system impact. Compiled a final forensic report with recommendations for containment, eradication, and recovery."

[[findings]]
memory_dump = "0zapftis.vmem"
summary = "Identified the 0zapftis malware family running in memory with process injection behavior. Discovered suspicious process (PID 1836) loading unauthorized DLLs and communicating with an external C2 server."

[[findings]]
memory_dump = "Coreflood.vmem"
summary = "Confirmed Coreflood botnet activity. Detected malicious process using unusual mutex names and outbound network traffic on port 8080. Extracted the binary and verified its hash as a known Coreflood sample via VirusTotal."

[[findings]]
memory_dump = "Memory.mem"
summary = "Detected evidence of keylogging activity. Extracted keystroke logs from memory and identified a malicious process that was hooking into user input APIs."

[[findings]]
memory_dump = "Zeus.vmem"
summary = "Identified Zeus trojan running in memory. Extracted configuration file containing C2 server IPs, revealed credential-stealing modules targeting banking websites, and confirmed network beacons to external hosts."

[[findings]]
memory_dump = "WindowsXPProfessional.vmem"
summary = "Found traces of persistence mechanisms (registry Run keys) used by malware. Identified hidden process threads and DLL injection consistent with rootkit behavior."

key_learnings=[
" Developed practical experience in using the Volatility Framework for memory forensics.",
"Learned how to identify operating system profiles and parse memory dumps accurately",
"Gained skills in extracting process lists, DLLs, network activity, and registry data to uncover malicious behavior",
"Strengthened knowledge of correlating forensic findings with external threat intelligence (VirusTotal).",
"Built reporting skills to communicate findings and propose actionable security recommendations.",
]

recommendations=[
"Isolate affected systems and perform full disk forensics to identify additional persistence mechanisms.",
"Block identified C2 IPs and domains at the firewall and update network monitoring rules to alert on similar traffic",
"Patch vulnerable applications and enforce least privilege to minimize the risk of process injection.",
"Implement regular memory capture and scanning as part of proactive threat hunting.",
"Deploy EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) tools to detect rootkits, keyloggers, and suspicious process creation in real time."]
